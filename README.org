** About
This repository contains an Ansible playbook used to automate a home security camera setup.

** Requirements
+ Raspberry Pi with an enabled onboard camera module.
+ ~Ansible~

** Usage
1. Download Raspbian Lite from [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/][here]].
2. Use [[https://www.balena.io/etcher/][balenaEtcher]] to write the Raspbian image to the SD card that will be used with the Raspberry Pi. Additional instructions available [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md][here]]. Etcher is available for iOS, Windows, and Linux.
3. Enable SSH for the Raspberry Pi by placing an empty ~ssh~ file in ~/boot~. Detailed instructions about enabling remote access for the Raspberry Pi are available [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/][here]]. 
4. Enable passwordless authentication on the Raspberry Pi (instructions are available [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md][here]]).
5. If the Raspberry Pi is going to use a wireless connection that is WPA-2 encrypted, a network configuration needs to be provided via the ~/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf~ file. An empty template is provided. 
6. Use ~Ansible~ to install ~BabaGinka~.

** Prerequisites
+ Ansible

+ balenaEtcher (or other tool to write the OS image file to the SD card)
  

** Usage
1. Download the latest Raspberry Pi OS Lite from [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/][here]].
2. Use ~ssh-keygen~ to generate a paswordless ssh key to use with the pi. Save as ~~/.ssh/pikey_rsa~.
3. In the ~hosts~ file add the raspberry's IP address under the ~[rpi2]~ section.
4. Use [[https://www.balena.io/etcher/][balenaEtcher]] to write the OS image to the SD card that will be used with the Raspberry Pi. Additional instructions available [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md][here]]. Etcher is available for iOS, Windows, and Linux.
5. Enable SSH for the Raspberry Pi by placing an empty file named ~ssh~ in the ~/boot~ partition of the SD card. Detailed instructions about enabling remote access for the Raspberry Pi are available [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/][here]]. 
6. Connect the Raspberry Pi to the local router (via cable). You will need to know the IP address assigned to the Raspberry Pi (check your router, or use nmap).
